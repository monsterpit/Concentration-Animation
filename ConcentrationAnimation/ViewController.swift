            // so view is a var on UITapGestureRecognizer which is the view that was tapped on
            
            // casting as? PlayCardView because recognizer.view is just a UIView ofcourse UITapGestureRecognizer doesn't know anything about PlayCardView . I have to make sure that it is a fact a PlayCardView it should be because that's the only thing I added any of these tap gestures to
