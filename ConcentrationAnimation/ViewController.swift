//when I pick a card I want it to stop I want to stop being animated
//You picked a card you get to take a breath and look at your card and then
// if you flip the card back over or if it  doesn't match and it gets flipped over for you then I'm gonna give it a push
// because see how everything stopping so now choosing cards will start pushing them a little bit and get them going again
//So you can wait for the whole thing to slow down and stop and then you can pick a card
//but once you pick them they are all gonna move around again and be shuffled up again make it hard on you
// So that seems like a good compromise to me between constant movement and all sitting completely still

// So how am gonna do that well that's super easy to do because I have 1 behavior and if I remove an item from that behavior it's gonna automatically stop animating
// becausing nothing will be behaving there will be no behaviors operating on
