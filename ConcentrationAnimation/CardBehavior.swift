//Creating a UIDynamicBehavior subclass where we combine other once
//Combing our 3 differrentt behavior in VC Collison behavior ,item bahvior and push behavior
// It would be lot nicer if we had another behavior called CardBehavior and it had all those behavior as part of it and then we just add the card to the CardBehavior and we get the collision ,item and push behavior automatically
